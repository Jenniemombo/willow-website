<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
Hi, I’m Jennie — the heart behind Willow Wellness and Massage. I’m a dedicated massage therapist who believes that healing begins when people feel truly seen, supported, and cared for. My approach is grounded in compassion, intuition, and a deep respect for each person’s unique journey. Over the years, I’ve developed a style that blends therapeutic skill with a nurturing, restorative touch. Whether I’m offering deep tissue work, relaxation massage, lymphatic therapy, craniosacral techniques, pregnancy support, or cupping, my intention is always the same: to help you reconnect with your body, release tension, and feel safe and at ease.

<br><br>

The name Willow holds a special meaning for me. Willows are known for their strength, flexibility, and ability to bend without breaking — qualities I deeply value in both healing and everyday life. They symbolize resilience, grounding, and gentle support, which perfectly reflects the kind of space I aim to create for my clients. I want everyone who visits to feel that same sense of softness and strength: a place to breathe, to rest, and to return to yourself.

<br><br>

I’m passionate about working with people through all stages of life — whether you’re healing from injury, navigating pregnancy or postpartum, managing stress, or simply needing a quiet moment of care. My practice is client-centered, intuitive, and always tailored to your needs. I listen deeply, work mindfully, and hold space with kindness and respect.

<br><br>

At Willow Wellness and Massage, my hope is that you feel welcomed, nurtured, and empowered in your own healing process. You deserve a place to be cared for. A place to reset. A place to feel supported. I’m honored to provide that for you.
