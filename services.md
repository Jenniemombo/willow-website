## **Pre and post natal massage**

Prenatal massage is a gentle, supportive therapy designed specifically for the unique needs of expectant mothers. As your body changes during pregnancy, muscles and joints often experience extra tension and discomfort, especially in the back, hips, and shoulders. Prenatal massage can help reduce swelling, relieve aches, improve circulation, and promote relaxation, all while supporting emotional well-being. By providing a safe, nurturing environment, this therapy helps mothers-to-be feel cared for, connected to their bodies, and more comfortable throughout their pregnancy journey.

Postnatal massage focuses on recovery and rejuvenation after childbirth. It helps address muscle soreness, tension, and fatigue that can result from pregnancy and the demands of caring for a newborn. Techniques are tailored to gently restore balance, support healing, and promote relaxation, while also encouraging improved circulation and reduced stress. Postnatal massage not only nurtures the body but also provides a moment of self-care for new parents, helping them feel replenished, grounded, and ready to embrace the joys and challenges of parenthood.

## **Craniosacral**

Craniosacral therapy is a gentle, hands-on approach that helps release tension in the body’s nervous system, promoting deep relaxation and overall balance. Using light, precise touch, this therapy supports the natural flow of cerebrospinal fluid, encouraging the body’s own healing processes. It can be especially beneficial for those experiencing stress, chronic headaches, migraines, neck or back pain, anxiety, or sleep difficulties. Craniosacral therapy is also helpful for people recovering from injury or looking to enhance overall wellness, offering a soothing, restorative experience that nurtures both body and mind.


## **Lymphatic drainage** 

Lymphatic therapy is a gentle, specialized massage that helps support the body’s natural lymphatic system, promoting the removal of toxins and excess fluids. This therapy encourages healthy circulation, reduces swelling, and can help boost the immune system, leaving you feeling lighter, refreshed, and revitalized. It’s particularly beneficial for those recovering from surgery or injury, managing chronic swelling, or seeking overall wellness and detoxification. By stimulating the lymphatic flow, this therapy not only supports physical health but also provides a calming, restorative experience that nurtures both body and mind.

## **Cupping**

Cupping therapy is an ancient technique that uses gentle suction to lift the skin and underlying tissues, helping to release tension, improve circulation, and promote natural healing. It can be especially helpful for easing muscle tightness, reducing pain, and supporting overall wellness. Many clients find it deeply relaxing, while also noticing improved mobility and a sense of lightness in their body. Cupping is ideal for those looking to relieve stress, recover from muscle strain, or enhance their body’s natural healing processes.

## **Rattan**

Rattan massage is a unique therapy that uses smooth, firm rattan sticks to roll and knead the muscles, providing deep tissue release and improved circulation. It’s perfect for targeting areas of tension, promoting detoxification, and invigorating the body. This therapy can benefit anyone dealing with tight muscles, fatigue, or sluggish circulation, as well as those looking for a refreshing, energizing massage experience. Rattan massage combines therapeutic pressure with relaxation, leaving the body feeling revitalized and balanced.
