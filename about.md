Hi, I’m Jennie — the heart behind Willow Wellness and Massage.  
I’m a dedicated massage therapist who believes that healing begins when people feel truly seen, supported, and cared for. My approach is grounded in compassion, intuition, and a deep respect for each person’s unique journey.

Over the years, I’ve developed a style that blends therapeutic skill with a nurturing, restorative touch. Whether I’m offering deep tissue work, relaxation massage, lymphatic therapy, craniosacral techniques, pregnancy support, or cupping, my intention is always the same: to help you reconnect with your body, release tension, and feel safe and at ease.

The name Willow holds a special meaning for me. Willows are known for their strength, flexibility, and ability to bend without breaking — qualities I deeply value in both healing and everyday life. They symbolize resilience, grounding, and gentle support, which perfectly reflects the kind of space I aim to create for my clients. I want everyone who visits to feel that same sense of softness and strength: a place to breathe, to rest, and to return to yourself.

I’m passionate about working with people through all stages of life — whether you’re healing from injury, navigating pregnancy or postpartum, managing stress, or simply needing a quiet moment of care. My practice is client-centered, intuitive, and always tailored to your needs. I listen deeply, work mindfully, and hold space with kindness and respect.

At Willow Wellness and Massage, my hope is that you feel welcomed, nurtured, and empowered in your own healing process.  
You deserve a place to be cared for. A place to reset. A place to feel supported.  
I’m honored to provide that for you.
